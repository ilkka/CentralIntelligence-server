# Central Intelligence system

## What is it?

A distributed client-server system for communicating between users and machines.

First use case to be covered will be a voice controlled chat bot (https://github.com/mikko/moneypenny) installed in multiple computers and able to answer to several questions related to the context of the user. Like asking the room temperature and answering based on the client location.

## Does this make any sense?

Not yet sure..
